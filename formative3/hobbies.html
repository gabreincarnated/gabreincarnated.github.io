                        <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
                        <p>I have plenty of hobbies that I like doing. As you can see from the picture, I really like jogging! I have a good intereset towards taking care of myself. So things like working out and jogging are things that I really like doing on my free time. Other than that, I often listen to music and play videogames. Listening to music is something that seems to just be embedded in my brain. I am almost incapable of doing chores without some sort of music playing around.</p>
                        <p>On a more practical standpoint, I also did modeling. I recently won Mr. Arellano University last year thanks to my previous experiences as a kid. Doing things in the entertainment industry has always been what I wanted to do when I was still a child. But as I grew up, I started to lean to the creative industry more because of my program. But luckily, these two do have some overlaps specially in film.</p>
