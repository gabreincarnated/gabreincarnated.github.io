                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                        <p>Hello there! My name is Gab, I just refer to "Rhubarb" as my nickname online! I am 19 years old, being born at September 8, 2006. I currently live at Malabon City, and I have been for pretty much my entire life. I am currently taking Multimedia Arts at Far Eastern University Institute of Technology, and this blog should act as a get-to-know-me tool in that context!</p>
                        <p>I can spend countless hours talking about what I do and what I love. And my college journey is only making them ever so vast. Even though I wouldn't even really call myself a decent artist, I did have some projects here and there that I am more proud of more than others. I usually connect the ideas in my projects to the things I love and spend the most time doing the most. Things that has something to do with music like my favorite band Radiohead, and my favorite games like Geometry Dash, are things you would certainly notice as references on most of my projects.</p>
                        <p>Everything accounting my personality can be connected with the things I love. You can learn more about them on other pages! See you there!</p>
