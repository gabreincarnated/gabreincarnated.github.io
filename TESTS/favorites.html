                        <h3>My Favorites</h3>
                        <p>I can spend an entire day talking about my favorites about anything. Especially, when you ask my about music. My favorite Band is Radiohead, and my favorite song is Let Down also by radiohead, and my favorite album is In Rainbows which is also by radiohead. I have always been familiar with Creep. But I only started to dive deep in their discography at around late 2022.</p>
                        <p>Of course, It doesn't mean that Radiohead is the only band that I regularly listen to. There are other bands that I also listen to from time to time like The Strokes, Third Eye Blind, Black Country, New Road, and The Magnetic Fields.</p>
                        <p>My favorite game on the other hand, is Geometry Dash. There's just something about this old popular mobile game that makes me and evereyone else playing it stick around for as long as we do. My hardest completion to date is Supersonic which is an Insane Demon, and I do aspire on making it to the demon list.</p>
